"*Before he was a hero, he was a farmer. Live the humble beginnings of Robin Hood by following three ancient rules: harvest your land, find your steed, and forge your saddle — all while protecting your farm from danger. Every hero’s journey starts small… but yours begins here.*"





Before Robin Hood became the hero of the people, he lived a quiet life tending to his small riverside farm. But one morning, a mysterious traveler arrived at his door. The traveler warned him:

“*If you wish to journey to the city and fight for justice, you must first prove you can follow the Three Rules.*”



These **Three Rules** were written in an ancient book lying on the table by Robin’s home:



**Harvest What You Sow** – Collect at least 50 bundles of wheat and 50 pieces of vegetables from your fields. Prove that patience and hard work bear fruit.



**Find Your Steed** – A hero needs a swift companion. Travel beyond the farm, through the forest and rocky paths, and find the lost horse. Beware of wild beasts along the way.



**Forge the Saddle** – Saddles aren’t found, they’re made. Gather rare resources scattered across the land to craft the perfect saddle for your steed.



While completing these tasks, Robin must care for his farm and protect his animals from predators that may attack at any moment. If the farm falls into ruin, his journey ends before it even begins.



Only after following these three rules will Robin earn the right to leave his village, ride to the city, and take his first step toward becoming the legendary protector of the poor.
